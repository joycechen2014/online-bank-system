## Weekly Scrum Report - Zhekai Hu


WEEK #1 (Nov11 - Nov15) 
   - Had first meeting with teammates about the project
   - Had a discussion about the framework and tools we would use.
   - Did some research about Spring Boot
   - XP Core Value: Respect
	- One of most important aspects in a team project is respect. During the every meeting, when each teammates express their opinion or suggestions, we should show our respect to them. Only in this way, teammates can get along well and make the project more efficient.



WEEK #2 (Nov18 - Nov22) 
   - Install and configure Spring Boot environment
   - Continued learning Spring Boot.
   - Shared information during the process of installing.
   - XP Core Values: Respect
	- As a teammate, we should learn how to accept other teammates’ feedback and suggestion. If we do not care others’ opinion, the whole team cannot be united and other teammates may do not show respect to yourself too.



WEEK #3 (Nov25 - Nov29) 
   - Design database with teammates via zoom and implements code.
   - Finished the API that supporting searching transactions and making transfer between accounts
- XP Core Values: Respect 
	- In the team meeting, some teammates had different design on database. Although they insisted on their own design at first, they still show enough respect to each other. At last, we made a vote to choose the design. If there was no respect between each teammates, it would be hard for us to keep doing the project with being united and efficient. 



WEEK #4 (Dec2 - Dec6) 
   - Integrate testing with other team members
   - Gather all reports and stuff together
- XP Core Values: Respect
	- After finished the project, we get to understand how important respects is in a team project. With no respect, it is hard for each teammates to feel the value of themselves in the team. They may feel unconfident and self-suspected. In this case, the team project will never be finished with good quality.
