## Use Case:

Online Banking system. 
* Design and implement supporting APIs for a banking system including a Database of your choice to persist Customer data.

        - register for new user
        - Adding new accounts - Checking, Savings
        - Deposit money
        - Closing existing accounts
        - Transfer between accounts - one time or recurring
        - Set up recurring or one-time Bill payment for external payees
        - View and search Transactions - for credits/debits/checks/fees - up to Â last 18 months
        - (Admin only) - Add transactions - such as manual refunds on fees

## Deploy 
   - Deploy API to **AWS in an Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster** with Load Balancer
   
### Deploy API and Database to Docker Containers in AWS     
   
   1. Create a online-banking app docker image: 
   docker build -t online-banking-app .
   
   2. Create a online-banking db docker image:
   ```
   FROM mysql:5.7
   Add a database
   ENV MYSQL_DATABASE onlinebanking
   COPY V1__20190307_Init_Tables_Data.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
   docker build -t online-banking-db .
   ```
   2. Push docker images to AWS ECR:
   ```
   docker tag online-banking-app:latest 120231263760.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/online-banking-app:latest
   docker push 120231263760.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/online-banking-app:latest
  
   docker tag online-banking-db:latest 120231263760.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/online-banking-db:latest
   docker push 120231263760.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/online-banking-db:latest
   ```
   3. Use docker compose to start up docker containers:
   ```
   version: '3'
   
   services:
     mysql-docker-container:
       image: 120231263760.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/online-banking-db
       environment:
         - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=welcome1
         - MYSQL_DATABASE=onlinebanking
         - MYSQL_USER=root
         - MYSQL_PASSWORD=welcome1
       volumes:
         - /data/mysql
     online-banking:
       image: 120231263760.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/online-banking-app
       depends_on:
         - mysql-docker-container
       ports:
         - 8080:8080
       volumes:
         - /data/online-banking
   
   docker-compose up 
   ```
