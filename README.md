**Use Case:**

Online Banking system (that can be accessed through Web/Mobile). - Design and implement supporting APIs for a banking system including a Database of your choice to persist Customer data.

The emphasis here is on team collaboration, so the points awarded will be based on individual contributions to the team and how the team performed overall.  Extra credit will be given for additional challenges as spelled out below.

**Suggested Project Components and Extra Credit (don't limit to these): (50 points)**

- **Components (one component per team member)  **
    - **APIs - **one per team member - input and output of API should be in JSON and should include error handling and validation of inputs
    - APIs can be demonstrated using a basic Web/mobile UI or through Postman
    - UI will be used by Customers and Bankers (Admins)
    - APIs should support following functionality:
        - register for new user
        - Adding new accounts - Checking, Savings
        - Closing existing accounts
        - Transfer between accounts - one time or recurring
        - Set up recurring or one-time Bill payment for external payees
        - View and search Transactions - for credits/debits/checks/fees - up to  last 18 months
        - (Admin only) - Add transactions - such as manual refunds on fees
        - Deploy API to **AWS in an Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster** with Load Balancer
        - Web or mobile UI

  
**Individual Requirements**

- Select and _**own one of the componen**_ts in the Team project.
- Keep a **Project Journal on GitHub** in markdown format to include:
    - **Weekly Scrum Report** (i.e. weekly version of daily scrum) which answers the tree daily stand-up questions:
        - What tasks did I work on / complete?
        - What am I planning to work on next?
        - What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

    - Select one of the **XP Core Values** and keep a journal of how the team kept these values throughout the project.  Report this in your Project Journal with the weekly Scrum Report submissions:
        - Communication
        - Simplicity
        - Feedback
        - Courage
        - Respect

- **Maintain Weekly Scrum Task Board (in GitHub as a Project Board) **
    - Update the **Story** on your Task Board
    - Keep track of **remaining effort (hours)** and progress on a Team Task Board.
    - Use (and modify) the **Google Task Sheet** Template at:  

        - Click on this [LINK (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RBzwUDx9QG7Uy8ayiFBBuhWBaJCrK5dV5T9eN2ZEfp8/edit?usp=sharing).  (Make adjustments to fit your team size)
        - Track your Team's **Burndown Chart** in this Sheet.

**Team Requirements  (This work should be done collaboratively -- i.e. Team ownership)**

- Maintain the project in an assigned **Team GitHub Repo**.
- Maintain a **Scrum Task Board (using GitHub Project Board)**
- Create **UI Wireframes**

- Create an Overall **Architecture Diagram (this does not have to be in UML) **showing:  

    - Software Components and their Public Interfaces
    - The Dependencies between Components
    - The Relative Relationship of how these components are Deployed
    - Recommendation:  Use UML Deployment/Component Diagram Notation.

- Maintain a README markdown file in the Team's GitHub Repo.
    - Include all **Diagrams**, **Design decisions** and the overall **Feature Set** of the project

- Perform **Project Demo**
    - Give a demo of your teams working prototype on "Demo Day"

#### **Grading: **

- Teams will be be graded with a **Team Score during Demo Day.**  

    - **50 Points Max from Requirements**
    - **20 Points Max from Extra Credit**

- Individual deductions will be made to the Team Score based on contributions to be judged by:
    - **Completeness and Functioning Demo of your Component (as noted on Demo Day)**
    - **Frequency and Quality of commits** to the project Github. 
        - As such, it is expected that all contributions must be visible via Github.  See the following guidelines for how GitHub counts contributions:  [https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/)

#### **Submission (One per Team):**

- **Your Team Name **
- **The names of each team member**
- **A summary of areas of contributions (for each team member) **
- **Link to your team's GitHub Repo**
- **Link to your team's Project Board (on GitHub) **
- **Link to your team's Project Journal (on GitHub)**
- **Link to your team's Google Sprint Task Sheet**
